/**
 * A Simple Game of Bounce.
 * 
 * The game has three states: StartUp, Playing, and GameOver, the game
 * progresses through these states based on the user's input and the events that
 * occur. Each state is modestly different in terms of what is displayed and
 * what input is accepted.
 * 
 * In the playing state, our game displays a moving rectangular "ball" that
 * bounces off the sides of the game container. The ball can be controlled by
 * input from the user.
 * 
 * When the ball bounces, it appears broken for a short time afterwards and an
 * explosion animation is played at the impact site to add a bit of eye-candy
 * additionally, we play a short explosion sound effect when the game is
 * actively being played.
 * 
 * Our game also tracks the number of bounces and syncs the game update loop
 * with the monitor's refresh rate.
